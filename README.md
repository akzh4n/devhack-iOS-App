# Ourapart (Developer Hackathon App)

Ourapart is an application (pet project) I developed for the Developer Hackathon from Terricon Valley. 

This is one of the cases in which we were able to implement our solution by creating an incident manager-related axis.

The project was developed in a short time, since it was a hackathon for 2 days, there are some points where unfinished and there are bugs, given that all the same, I put it in the portfolio.
